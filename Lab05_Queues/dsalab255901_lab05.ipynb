    "## Overview\n",
    "A *queue* data structure is a specialized list in which items can only be added to one end and remove from the other end. The queue structure is suitable for problems that required data to be processed in the order in which it was received (i.e. **First-In-First-Out** principle). Examples of problems that exploit queues include shared printer management, computer simulations, CPU process scheduling. An abstract view of a queue is shown in Figure 1 below.\n",

    "### Defining the Queue ADT\n",
    "A *queue* is a collection of items in which access is restricted to a *first-in-first-out* basis. New items are inserted at the back and existing items are removed from the front. The items are maintained in the order in which they are added to the queue.\n",

    "- **enqueue( item )** : Adds the given item to the back of the queue.\n",

    "When a share of common stock of some company is sold, the **capital gain** (or, sometimes, **loss**) is the difference between the share's selling price and the price originally paid to buy it. This rule is easy to understand for a single share, but if we sell multiple shares of stock bought over a long period of time, then we must identify the shares actually being sold. A standard accounting principle for identifying which shares of a stock were sold in such a case is to use a **FIFO protocol**—the shares sold are the ones that have been held the longest (indeed, this is the default method built into several personal finance software packages). For example, suppose we buy 100 shares at $20$ Baht each on day 1, 20 shares at 24 Baht on day 2, 200 shares at 36 Baht on day 3, and then sell 150 shares on day 4 at 30 Baht each. Then applying the FIFO protocol means that of the 150 shares sold, 100 were bought on day 1, 20 were bought on day 2, and 30 were bought on day 3. The capital gain in this case would therefore be 100 · 10 + 20 · 6 + 30 · (−6), or 940 Baht. \n",
